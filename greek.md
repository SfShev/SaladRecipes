# Greek Salad Recipe
## Ingredinets:
* Cucumbers
* Tomatoes
* Bell Pepper
* Red Onion
* Olives
* Feta

## Recommendation 1

In Greece you’ll most often find large tomatoes used, but cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes make for easy dicing.
And for the feta, make sure to opt for a quality block of feta.
I highly recommend you don’t buy pre-crumbled feta, due to the anti-caking additives
I mentioned on my Zucchini Fries recipes.
