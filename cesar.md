## Cooking Method

1. Chop together anchovy fillets, garlic, and pinch of salt.
Use the side of a knife blade to mash into a paste, then scrape into a medium bowl. Whisk in egg yolks, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and mustard.
Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in olive oil, then vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy.
Whisk in Parmesan. Season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.

2. CROUTONS:
Preheat oven to 375°. Toss bread with olive oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.
Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, 10–15 minutes.

3. ASSEMBLY:
Place whole romaine leaves (for the ideal mix of crispness, surface area, and structure) in a large bowl.
Use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount of Parmesan (a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing).
Use your hands to gently toss together the lettuce, croutons, and dressing. Top with the shaved Parm.
